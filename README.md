# Unexpected Navigation Behavior in React Router Dom v6

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with React Router Dom v6 where navigation between routes doesn't behave as expected. The navigation sometimes fails, gets stuck on a previous route, or displays the wrong component.

## Bug Description

The issue appears when using nested routes or when transitioning between routes with complex layouts.  Navigation does not reliably update the displayed component.  Sometimes, the URL updates but the component does not.  Other times, the component updates, but the URL does not.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages. Note that navigation might be inconsistent.

## Solution

The solution involves reviewing the route definitions for potential conflicts or errors.  Additionally, ensure that the `BrowserRouter` is correctly wrapped around the main application and that the `Routes` and `Route` components are properly nested.
